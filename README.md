# OpinionResponseFunctions
The code used in the paper "Opinion response functions and other formulations of a social model".

Files starting ODE are used for the ODE models, files starting with OpResp are used for the opinion response functions, and files starting with ABM are used for the agent based model. Python 3.9.12 (Spyder 5.4.3) is used for all files in this project.
